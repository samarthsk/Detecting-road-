# Detecting-road-
Detecting the Road lanes using OpenCV
•	Tools used: PyCharm.
•	Language used: Python 3.
•	Libraries used: cv2, Numpy, Matplotlib.
•	Imported the required libraries.
•	Imported the test image in an array.
•	Changed the color of the image from RGB to Grayscale for less intensity.
•	Filtered the image noise, which can create false edges and ultimately affect edge detection.
•	Used Gaussian blur to smoothened the image.
•	Used the Edge Detection algorithm canny, which identifies the boundaries of objects within the images. And also, to outline the strongest gradients in the image. 
•	Used Matplotlib to identify the region of interest.
•	Created a polygon on the region of interest and masked the polygon using fill poly and Numpy creating arrays to the region of interest.
•	Used Hough-Transform algorithm to detect the straight lines in the image.
•	Detected the straight lines by changing the intensity of the lines to blue color over a black color background.
•	Finally, Blended the line image on top of the original image.
•	Then, averaged the left line coordinates and the right line coordinates for a perfect fit.
•	Further imported the mp4 video of the lane and executed the same algorithm on the video.
•	As expected, it detects the lanes as were seen in the image.
